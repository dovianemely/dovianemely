### Hi there ğŸ‘‹
ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML & CSS (please visit my first project! https://dovianemely.github.io/bidulgi.co/)<br>
ğŸŒ± I'm interested in learning Javascript as well (is it hard?)
<br>I have a personal blog and I learn front-end languages to improve the appearance :)
<br>I really recommend <a href="https://progate.com/">Progate</a> to learn everything from scratch~ Even for someone who doesn't have any IT background like me!

Thank you for visiting!ğŸ˜„
